This project is a flask-based web application built using Flask, designed for encrypting and decrypting text using three different encryption algorithms: RC4, RC5, and RC6. It provides a simple interface where users can select an action (encryption or decryption), choose a cipher, input a key, and provide text to process. The app then displays the result based on the user's inputs.

Key Features
Multiple Cipher Support: Implements RC4, RC5, and RC6 algorithms for text encryption and decryption.
User-Friendly Interface: Simplified design with intuitive input fields for ease of use.
Real-Time Processing: Displays results instantly after processing the input text.
How It Works
Select an Action: Users choose between encryption or decryption.
Choose a Cipher: The application supports three ciphers:
RC4: A stream cipher using a key scheduling algorithm and pseudorandom number generator.
RC5: A block cipher with adjustable parameters (simplified in this app).
RC6: A block cipher and improvement over RC5 (simplified in this app).
Enter a Key: A secret key is required to perform the operation.
Provide Input Text: Users enter plaintext for encryption or ciphertext for decryption.
View the Result: The output is displayed on the same page after processing.
Benefits
Encryption and Decryption in One App: Offers a unified platform to handle both processes.
Cross-Platform Support: Accessible on any device with a web browser.
Simplified Algorithm Implementation: Makes learning and experimenting with encryption easier.
Use Cases
Learning and understanding encryption techniques.
Small-scale text-based encryption and decryption tasks.
Demonstrating how RC4, RC5, and RC6 algorithms function in practice.
